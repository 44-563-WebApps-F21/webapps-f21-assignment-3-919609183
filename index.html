    <h3>Geometry Elementary</h3>
    <p> Geometry (from the Ancient Greek: γεωμετρία; geo- "earth", -metron "measurement") is, with arithmetic, one of the oldest branches of mathematics.
        It is concerned with properties of space that are related with distance, shape, size, and relative position of figures. A mathematician who works in 
        the field of geometry is called a geometer.Until the 19th century, geometry was almost exclusively devoted to Euclidean geometry,[a] which includes 
        the notions of point, line, plane, distance, angle, surface, and curve, as fundamental concepts. <br>During the 19th century several discoveries enlarged
         dramatically the scope of geometry. One of the oldest such discoveries is Gauss' Theorema Egregium ("remarkable theorem") that asserts roughly that the Gaussian curvature
         <br> of a surface is independent from any specific embedding in a Euclidean space. This implies that surfaces can be studied intrinsically, that is as 
         stand alone spaces, and has been expanded into the theory of manifolds and Riemannian geometry.
